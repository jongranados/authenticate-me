## Project Overview
Authenticate Me is a lightweight full-stack application designed as my stepping stone into the world of full-stack development. The project incorporates foundational elements commonly found in web applications: account creation, login, logout, along with a tried-and-true user authentication and authorization pattern.

## Goals
- **Grasp Core Functionality**: As my first full-stack project, the goal was to understand and implement core web functionalities such as account creation, log in, log out, and user authentication.
- **Dive into Databases**: Delve deep into PostgreSQL, understanding its strengths and intricacies to manage user data securely.
- **Data flow and state management**: Adopt and master the Redux Toolkit to manage the application's state efficiently and streamline data flow across components.
- **Decipher Authentication**: Build an application that's not only functional, but also resilient against common cyber threats.
- **Holistic Development**: Cement a foundational understanding of how front-end and back-end technologies intertwine and communicate, laying the groundwork for more complex projects in the future.
- **Deployment**: Experience the nuances and challenges of deploying a full-stack application, transitioning from a local development environment to a live platform accessible by users.

### Local Deployment
Follow these steps to run Authenticate Me on your local machine for development and testing.

- **Prerequisites**
    - Node.js & NPM
    - PostgreSQL

- **Installing**
    1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
    2. Navigate to the project directory.
    3. Create a `.env` file in `backend` and define the variables below for your PostgreSQL database, your desired JWT parameters, and bcrypt salt to be used for hashing:  
        ```
            PORT=5000
            DB_USERNAME=
            DB_PASSWORD=
            DB_DATABASE=
            DB_HOST=localhost
            JWT_SECRET=
            JWT_EXPIRES_IN=
            BCRYPT_SALT=
        ```
    4. Run `npm install` inside `frontend` to install all required front-end dependencies.
    5. Run `npm start` inside `frontend` to start the front-end.
    6. Run `npm install` inside `backend` to install all required back-end dependencies.
    7. Run `npm start` inside `backend` to start the back-end. 
    8. Run `dotenv npx sequelize db:migrate` inside `backend` to run Sequelize migrations. 
    9. Run `dotenv npx sequelize db:migrate` inside `backend` if you would like to seed the database with mock data.
